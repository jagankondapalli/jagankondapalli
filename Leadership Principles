## Jagan Kondapalli’s Leadership Philosophies

### 🔍 Why I Lead the Way I Do

I believe in **intent-based leadership**: express the intent, and trust the teams to determine the how. Clear, shared goals like OKRs empower autonomy and accountability.

- **Fail Fast, Learn Fast, Recover Fast**: We embrace mistakes not because we want them, but because humble learners recover faster than perfect thinkers.
- **No Internal Competition**: My success = team success = org success. We rise together.
- **Trust is the Foundation of Agility**: Politics and fear undermine scale. I build trust at scale to unlock distributed decision-making.
- **Keep It Small**: Deliver the smallest customer-visible unit that makes a difference. MVP → MLP → Insight.
- **Keep It Simple**: Practice just-enough engineering.
- **One Thing at a Time, Done Right**: Avoid the trap of multitasking. Prioritize focus.

### 🔒 My Non-Negotiables

- **Transparency**: We operate in a safe space. Information is shared, not hoarded.
- **Ownership**: No victims, only owners. Step up. Drive change.
- **Solution-Oriented**: We reject negativity, over-optimism, or passive hope. Action wins.
- **Mentorship**: Always train your replacement. Grow others while growing yourself.
- **Tooling Philosophy**: Vision → Principles → Practices → Tools. Never the other way around.

### 🛠️ How I Work

- **Continuous Prioritization**: Focus isn’t a one-time act — it's a daily discipline.
- **Know Your Customers**: Listen often, deeply, and directly.
- **Painkillers Before Vitamins**: Solve urgent needs before scaling wishlists.
- **Act Like an Owner**: Care deeply. Think long-term. Invest like it’s yours.
