## 👋 About Me

I'm a senior engineering leader passionate about **platform reliability, developer experience, and AI-driven transformation**. My work spans across:

- 🚀 Leading global engineering teams focused on **cloud infrastructure, SRE, and DevOps modernization**
- 🔧 Designing resilient platforms with **SLOs, observability, self-healing, and service maturity models**
- 🤖 Embedding **AI-native workflows** into developer tools and incident management
- 🧠 Driving long-term product vision, architectural simplification, and team empowerment

I blend **technical depth with strategic execution**, bridging the gap between engineering, product, and business.

## 📦 Featured Projects

- **[AegisAI](https://inno-hq.github.io/aegisai-nhi-governance/pitch/pitch_deck.html)**  
  A strategic identity governance layer purpose-built for AI and cloud-native ecosystems. AegisAI maps non-human identities (NHI), enforces fine-grained access policies through a YAML-based DSL, and provides audit capabilities — helping engineering and security leaders reduce risk from overprivileged AI agents, service accounts, and API keys.

- **[Production Readiness Bot](https://github.com/jagankondapalli/production-readiness-bot)**  
  A developer-native GitHub bot that automates production readiness checks using structured YAML maturity models. This enables engineering orgs to codify reliability gates, improve service standards, and ensure consistent platform quality at scale — without blocking velocity.

- **[Obliq](https://github.com/inno-hq/Obliq-Product-Strategy)**  
  An AI-powered journaling and self-coaching platform designed for individuals and teams to reflect, adapt, and grow. Obliq integrates a modular LLM engine, mood-aware insight timelines, and tone-based prompt logic — enabling continuous personal development and emotionally intelligent self-observation.

- **[AI-Powered VS Code Extension for NetApp’s 1P Cloud storage](https://github.com/NetApp/anf-vscode-extension)**
A VS Code extension that brings Azure NetApp Files (ANF) storage management directly into your development environment. Manage storage resources, generate templates, and get AI-powered recommendations without leaving VS Code

## 💼 Prior Engineering Outcomes

- Lead the global rollout of a unified **SLI/SLO platform**, enabling engineering teams to define, measure, and visualize service health across thousands of microservices and multicloud environments  
- Design a just-in-time troubleshooting framework that replaces static dashboards with dynamic, AI-assisted incident diagnostics — improving time-to-mitigation and reducing manual toil  
- Migrate legacy infrastructure to a self-service IaC platform, driving standardization and compliance through policy-backed Terraform/Bicep templates and GitOps workflows  
- Launch a developer enablement suite (CLIs, templates, CI/CD scaffolds) that reduces time-to-first-commit for new services and fosters internal platform adoption across dozens of teams  
- Establish a cross-org production readiness review (PRR) model with automated checklists, YAML enforcement, and maturity scoring — making service launch criteria programmatic and auditable  
- Introduce AI-native agent workflows in operations and engineering pipelines, integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and decision support into developer tools and service automation  
- Engineer a large-scale service migration from a monolithic cluster architecture to a cell-based cluster topology using dual-write proxies and data backfill jobs, enabling zero-downtime transition while reducing query latency and improving performance for high-volume tenants  
- Architect a multi-cluster (“cell”) strategy for large-document tenants, breaking out monolithic Elasticsearch clusters into smaller, tenant-aware clusters. Implement request-routing proxies and parallel backfill jobs to migrate data without downtime, dramatically improving search throughput, reducing query latency, and stabilizing shard load across clusters

## 🧭 Philosophy

➡️ See also: [My Leadership Principles](./Leadership_Principles.md)

- “Strong platforms don’t just scale systems — they scale teams.”  
- Empower engineers with tools and context to move fast **without breaking reliability**  
- Build teams grounded in shared purpose, psychological safety, and autonomy  
- Embrace careers and lives rooted in reflection, reinvention, and choosing growth over comfort
