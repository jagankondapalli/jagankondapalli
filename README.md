## 👋 About Me

I'm a senior engineering leader passionate about **platform reliability, developer experience, and AI-driven transformation**. My work spans across:

- 🚀 Leading global engineering teams focused on **cloud infrastructure, SRE, and DevOps modernization**
- 🔧 Designing resilient platforms with **SLOs, observability, self-healing, and service maturity models**
- 🤖 Embedding **AI-native workflows** into developer tools and incident management
- 🧠 Driving long-term product vision, architectural simplification, and team empowerment

I blend **technical depth with strategic execution**, bridging the gap between engineering, product, and business.

## 📦 Featured Projects

- **[AegisAI](https://inno-hq.github.io/aegisai-nhi-governance/pitch/pitch_deck.html#1))**  
  A strategic identity governance layer purpose-built for AI and cloud-native ecosystems. AegisAI maps non-human identities (NHI), enforces fine-grained access policies through a YAML-based DSL, and provides audit capabilities — helping engineering and security leaders reduce risk from overprivileged AI agents, service accounts, and API keys.

- **[Obliq](https://github.com/inno-hq/Obliq-Product-Strategy)**  
  An AI-powered journaling and self-coaching platform designed for individuals and teams to reflect, adapt, and grow. Obliq integrates a modular LLM engine, mood-aware insight timelines, and tone-based prompt logic — enabling continuous personal development and emotionally intelligent self-observation.

## 💼 Prior Engineering Outcomes

- Lead the global rollout of a unified **SLI/SLO platform**, enabling engineering teams to define, measure, and visualize service health across thousands of microservices and multicloud environments  
- Design a just-in-time troubleshooting framework that replaces static dashboards with dynamic, AI-assisted incident diagnostics — improving time-to-mitigation and reducing manual toil  
- Migrate legacy infrastructure to a self-service IaC platform, driving standardization and compliance through policy-backed Terraform/Bicep templates and GitOps workflows  
- Launch a developer enablement suite (CLIs, templates, CI/CD scaffolds) that reduces time-to-first-commit for new services and fosters internal platform adoption across dozens of teams  
- Establish a cross-org production readiness review (PRR) model with automated checklists, YAML enforcement, and maturity scoring — making service launch criteria programmatic and auditable  
- Introduce AI-native agent workflows in operations and engineering pipelines, integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and decision support into developer tools and service automation  
- Engineer a large-scale service migration from a monolithic cluster architecture to a cell-based cluster topology using dual-write proxies and data backfill jobs, enabling zero-downtime transition while reducing query latency and improving performance for high-volume tenants  
- Architect a multi-cluster (“cell”) strategy for large-document tenants, breaking out monolithic Elasticsearch clusters into smaller, tenant-aware clusters. Implement request-routing proxies and parallel backfill jobs to migrate data without downtime, dramatically improving search throughput, reducing query latency, and stabilizing shard load across clusters

## 🧭 Philosophy

➡️ See also: [My Leadership Principles](./Leadership_Principles.md)

- “Strong platforms don’t just scale systems — they scale teams.”  
- Empower engineers with tools and context to move fast **without breaking reliability**  
- Build teams grounded in shared purpose, psychological safety, and autonomy  
- Embrace careers and lives rooted in reflection, reinvention, and choosing growth over comfort
